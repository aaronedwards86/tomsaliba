# tomsaliba.com

Personal site for Tom Saliba, built on the same design system as aaroncharlesedwards.com: a single-page static HTML site (no build step, no framework) designed for Netlify hosting.

This repository is the site's permanent home. It was originally staged as a `tomsaliba-site/` folder inside the `aaroncharlesedwards-site` repo (reviewed via that repo's deploy previews) and has been moved here for launch.

## What's in the box

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The entire site: markup, styles, and scripts in one file |
| `tom-headshot-placeholder.svg` | Temporary hero portrait — replace with a real photo |
| `favicon.*`, `apple-touch-icon.png` | "TS" monogram icons, all sizes |
| `netlify.toml` | Netlify config (static publish, deploy previews) |
| `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` | SEO basics, already pointed at tomsaliba.com |
| `CONTENT-CHECKLIST.md` | Every placeholder that needs Tom's real content |

## Launch steps

### 1. Connect Netlify

1. In Netlify: **Add new site → Import an existing project → GitHub** → pick this repo (`aaronedwards86/tomsaliba`).
2. Build command: leave **empty**. Publish directory: `.` (the `netlify.toml` already says this).
3. Deploy. You'll get a `something.netlify.app` URL immediately — use it to review with Tom.

### 2. Point the domain

1. Buy `tomsaliba.com` (Netlify can register it, or use any registrar).
2. In Netlify: **Domain management → Add custom domain** → `tomsaliba.com`.
3. If the domain is at an external registrar, either switch its nameservers to Netlify DNS (easiest) or add the A/CNAME records Netlify shows you.
4. HTTPS is provisioned automatically once DNS resolves.

### 3. Turn on the contact form

The form is already wired for **Netlify Forms** (`data-netlify="true"`). After the first deploy:

1. In Netlify: **Forms** → confirm the `contact` form was detected.
2. **Form notifications** → add Tom's email so submissions land in his inbox.

If the site is ever hosted somewhere other than Netlify, swap the form for a [Formspree](https://formspree.io) endpoint instead.

### 4. Finish the content

The copy is drawn from Tom's 2026 CV — hero, experience cards, track-record numbers, about story, and lecturing credentials are all real. What remains is in `CONTENT-CHECKLIST.md`, chiefly:

- **Portrait** — a real editorial photo saved as `tom-headshot.jpg` (3:4 crop, ≥1000px wide), then update the hero `<img src>`; the OG image path in `<head>` already expects that filename.
- **LinkedIn URL** — contact section, footer, and JSON-LD `sameAs`.
- **Email confirmation** — currently the CV's `saliba_t@hotmail.com`.
- **Tom's sign-off** on the published numbers.

Two sections ship **hidden** until there's real content for them (search `display:none` in `index.html`): the featured video in Lecturing, and the entire Press section.

### 5. Post-launch polish

- Add the site to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) and drop the verification meta tag into `<head>`.
- Submit `https://tomsaliba.com/sitemap.xml` there.
- Expand the JSON-LD Person schema in `<head>` with `jobTitle`, `worksFor`, and `sameAs` (LinkedIn) once the facts are final.
- Test on a phone — the layout is responsive, but check the hero photo crop.

## Editing notes

- Everything is in `index.html`. Styles are in the `<style>` block, organized by section with `── Section ──` comment banners.
- Colors and fonts are CSS variables at the top of the `<style>` block (`--bg`, `--text`, `--accent`, etc.) — change the whole palette in one place.
- The scrolling logo strip needs its list of logos duplicated once, back to back, for the seamless loop.
